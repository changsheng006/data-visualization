# Changsheng Chen: Data Visulization (KULeuven)
This website is to save the coding files that Changsheng Chen worked for the exam project of data visulization.
The whole work finished by Changsheng Chen can be summarized in the follows.

For the blog part, I wrote 5 blogs individually, including “Scope and Research Question”, “Dashboard Ideas”, “Plotting maps using vega”, “How to choose neighbourhood in Brussels, Antwerp or Ghent?” and “Which city is the best choice to stay?”. Besides, I also wrote part of content in the blog “What do we work on?”.

For the coding (plot) part, I finished 6 interactive plots individually, including 4 interactive plots by vega-lite in the blog “How to choose neighbourhood in Brussels, Antwerp or Ghent?” and “Which city is the best choice to stay?”, and 2 interactive map plots by python (Package: folium) in the blog “Plotting maps using vega”. Besides, I also work on two plots with team mates in the blog “Making it interactive - Comparing Cities” by R (Package: Altair).

The data file can be found on: https://github.com/changsheng006/data

The code file can be find on this page: 

The map codes: Please check the link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19CrYc4a1z4HXP85eodPg-xMZUKBKSRCd#scrollTo=8wmv32Xmcj5S (some codes can be found in "Exam project_data visualization20200430.ipynb" and shapefiles are also provided on this page)

The vega-lite codes: see files with .json

The plots by R (Package Altair): see "exam project_airbnb20200418.R"

For the video part, I finished the video of the interpretation for plots programmed by myself and collect all videos of other team mates to make the final video. The final video: check the link
